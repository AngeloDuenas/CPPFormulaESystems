2. System Warnings with other Subteams
   1. High Battery Temperature
   2. Wheel Temperatures
   3. Any type of system failure
   4. Generally will be a combination of LEDs and on-screen warnings
3. Main Controller:
   1. Teensy 4.1
4. Test Controller:
   1. Arduino MEGA 
### Buttons:
1. Responsible for Button Size
   1. Need to collaborate with ergonomics subteam
### Data Acquisition:
1. Direct USB Port inside the car to get data directly
2. Data acquired through bluetooth
### Kill Switch:
1. Abide by rules 8.10-8.20 in the FSAE Electric Rule book
2. Everything must be connected in series
